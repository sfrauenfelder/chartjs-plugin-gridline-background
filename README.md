# chartjs-plugin-gridline-background
Plugin for <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a> to display colored backgrounds per gridline.

This plugin fills the background of each gridline with configurable colors. Actually, it fills each space _between_ two gridlines.
The gridlines already had configurable foreground colors, and this plugin completes that function.

Tested with Chart.js 2.7.2.
